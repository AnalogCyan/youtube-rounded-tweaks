# YouTube Rounded Tweaks (Archived)

**Note:** This project is now **archived** and is no longer actively maintained. The recent updates on YouTube's design have addressed most of the issues that this userstyle aimed to fix, rendering it largely redundant.

This repository contains various tweaks and additions to the [YouTube Rounded](https://github.com/Adaoh2/youtube-rounded) userstyle.
